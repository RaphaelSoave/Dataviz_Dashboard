                The key factors driving the closures of educational institutions in France between 1970 and 2025 are primarily linked to demographic shifts, educational reforms, budgetary constraints, and regional disparities.
                - Demographic Changes: As populations in rural areas declined, schools in these regions were forced to close due to fewer students. Urban areas, like Île-de-France, also saw closures but balanced this with new schools opening, reflecting population shifts to cities.
                - Educational Reforms: Changes in the education system, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, led to many schools closing. These reforms focused on merging smaller schools and consolidating classes, particularly at the preschool level, which resulted in a high number of closures.
                - Budget Cuts: Public schools were hit hardest by financial cuts, leading to the closure of around 30,000 public institutions, compared to only 5,000 private schools. The reduction in government funding made it difficult for public schools to stay open.
                - Regional Differences: Some regions, like Grand Est, experienced more closures due to population decline, while Île-de-France had closures despite a high student population, driven by ongoing urban development. Budget cuts affected all regions to some extent.
                - Educational Level: Preschools were most affected by closures, as they merged with primary schools or shifted to larger formats. Primary and secondary schools saw fewer closures because they have larger classes and are essential to the education system.
                
                In summary, closures were mainly driven by changing populations, financial constraints, and educational reforms. Public schools and preschools were the most impacted, and regional differences highlight the need for targeted policies to manage school closures.""")
